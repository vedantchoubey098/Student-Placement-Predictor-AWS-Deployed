Student Placement Predictor is a machine learning model that predicts the probability of a student getting placed in a company based on various parameters such as academic performance, work experience, and other personal attributes. Once deployed on AWS, the model can be accessed through an API endpoint, 
allowing users to input their data and receive the predicted placement probability. This deployment on the cloud platform makes it easy to scale the model as needed 
and ensures high availability and reliability.
Overall, the Student Placement Predictor is a useful tool for students and placement coordinators to get an estimate of a student's chances of getting placed in a 
company, helping them make informed decisions and prepare accordingly.
